# Assignment #2 Submission Files
**REPOSITORY CONTENTS:** Python files for Problems 1, 2, and 3 and README docs for Assignment #2 submission.

I used Google CoLab as my IDE for writing this code. For ease of use, **please use CoLab or
a similar Jupyter notebook environment that allows you to run cells and upload files.**

**Please reach out to me at hlk21@fsu.edu if you have any issues running my code or need any further clarification.**

To run the assignments in Google CoLab, click the play button in the upper left-hand corner **after** uploading 
the data into the Files tab on the left hand side. You may have to sign into CoLab with a personal gmail
account because for some reason it did not work with my FSU email. The CoLab cell takes care of the 
execution of the code and you do not need to interact with a terminal. **The result will display at the
bottom of the code tab.**

If you have trouble viewing these Jupyter notebooks, please visit 
** [https://github.com/haydenkirkeide/CAP-5771-Assignment-2-Files/tree/main](url) **
to use the environment and information there.

# SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS FOR EACH PROBLEM
