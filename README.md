# Assignment #2 Submission Files
**REPOSITORY CONTENTS:** Python files for Problems 1, 2, and 3 and README docs for Assignment #2 submission.

I used Google CoLab as my IDE for writing this code. For ease of use, **please use CoLab or
a similar Jupyter notebook environment that allows you to run cells and upload files.**

# SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS FOR EACH PROBLEM

**Problem 1:** please upload "X_train.txt", "X_test.txt", "Y_train.txt", and "Y_test.txt"
from the assignment data folder into the CoLab Files tab to run the code.

**Problem 2:** please rename the "seeds.txt" file to "ASSMT2 P2.txt" and
upload the file into the CoLab Files tab so that, if you are running the code in CoLab, 
there are no issues when it comes to running the file.

**Problem 3:** please rename the "German_Credit_Data.txt" file to "ASSMT2 P3.txt" and
upload the file into the CoLab Files tab so that, if you are running the code in CoLab, 
there are no issues when it comes to running the file.
